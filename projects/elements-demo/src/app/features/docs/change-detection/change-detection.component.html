  <h1>Change detection</h1>
  <p>
    In this section we're going to curate and discuss various change detection
    related issues and lessons learned when using Angular Elements.

  <h2>
    RxJs stream runs in a wrong (parent / outer) zone.js [Angular Elements]
  </h2>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    This issue happens when using <code>&#64;angular/element</code> inside of a
    parent Angular application. The parent application and element will NOT run
    in the same zone. This will lead to problems with change detection inside of
    the element when the <code>rxjs</code> stream was triggered by the change of
    the <code>&#64;Input() prop</code> originating in the parent application.
  </p>
  <p>
    The stream will run in parent zone (instead of element zone) so any async
    operation (like backend request or using
    <code>debounceTime()</code> operator) will not trigger change detection of
    the element so the stream data will not be rendered...
  </p>
  <h3>Solution</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Do NOT use <code>zone.js</code> in your Angular element and trigger change
      detection manually
    </li>
    <li>
      Use single (parent) <code>NgZone</code> also for both the application and
      the element.
      <pre [highlight]="codeExampleShareNgZone" language="typescript"></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      Use <code>import 'zone.js/dist/zone-patch-rxjs';</code> in your Angular
      element. This will fix it BUT if the parent application (or ANY other lib
      used by the parent application) already has this import then the one in
      the element will be ignored and hence not solving the problem.
    </li>
  </ol>
